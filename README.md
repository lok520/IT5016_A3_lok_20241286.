 Requisition  System.

1.Staff Information
The system will start by taking the necessary information about the staff member. The date, staff ID, and name of the user are asked. This will guarantee that all requisition is properly associated with the individual that makes the request.

2.Item Requisition
Employees are capable of documenting the requests they desire. The program will require the name and the cost of each item. All the cost is computed automatically and many items are possible to process at a time in each requisition.

3.Approval Workflow
The program is used to calculate the overall cost to identify the approval status. The threshold of requisitions less than 500 is automatically approved. The ones that come within the range of $500-1000 are identified as pending and need manager approval. Any request costing over 1000 is automatically disapproved.

4.Manager Review
The manager can review pending requisitions and approve or reject the request. Approved requisitions are assigned a special approval reference number so as to be tracked.

5.Requisition Summary
Upon processing, a clear summary will be displayed in the program which will consist of staff details, total cost, approval status and the reference number. This guarantees transparency and facilitation of records keeping.

6.Statistics Tracking
The system maintains a record of every requisition with the number of total ones submitted, approved, pending and rejected. This is a feature that enables fast overview of the activity in general and assists in decision-making.

7.Educational Value
Although it is practical, the program is also an illustration of basic Python principles, such as classes, methods, loops, conditionals, and input. It is easy to follow and gives a close-to-life illustration of how an office requisition process can be automated..
